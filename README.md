unbox mogwai at start, you can choose to read the manual for him or ignore it, if you read it 

Manual: 
-Never feed him after midnight or before dawn 
-Never get him wet
-Keep him out of the sunlight 


What do you want to do?

    - (hunger (check to see if it's after midnight and before dawn --- if so GREMLIN- you lose the game)
2. Clean Gizmo 
    - Dust bath
    - Water bath ((If you water it, more mogwai appear and stats drain 4 times faster. you can give them away, (you can ask your neighbors but they'll randomly accept or reject the mogwai) if one of them eats after midnight (this will also be random) you lose the game))
3. Play with Gizmo
    - Go for a walk! (If it's daytime, it dies :( ) (boredom decreases by 2 for night walks)
    - Sing (boredom decreases by 3)
4. Check the Time

4. Put Gizmo to sleep 
    - tuck him in :) (tiredness drains as time ticks on) will wake naturally when tiredness reaches 0, option to wake him up appears
